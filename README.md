# Connection Checker

Quick script to check whether or not you are connected to the internet, with built in failsafe.

## Commitment Guidelines
- I don't really maintain this.
- I don't know what you'd want to maintain here.
- It's a script that pings two servers. 
- Have an issue but don't want to solve it yourself? Write a [ticket](https://github.com/DapfiDuck/OnlineChecker/issues)!
